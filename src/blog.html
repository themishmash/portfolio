        <h4>Losing Toenails on the Rwenzori Mountains in Western Uganda</h4>
        <p>10 July 2018 by Michelle Wong</p>
        <div class="backimg" title="Picture of Rwenzori Mountains"></div>
        <p>The mountains of the moon. Sounds pretty alluring doesn’t it? This is the name given to the Rwenzori mountains of Uganda, named after their snow capped peaks that resemble the moon. It’s also the reason I lost not one, but two toenails whilst summiting one of its peaks. I don’t regret it. Not one bit. In 2016 I first encountered these mountains whilst reading the book Ubuntu, where the author Heather Ellis travelled by motorcycle, solo, across most of Africa. Spoiler alert: It was an entertaining read but I thought to myself, she is crazy. Like completely and utterly batty.</p>

          <h4>Autumnal leaves on the Maluti mountains in South Africa</h4>
          <p>30 June 2018 by Michelle Wong</p>
          <div class="backimg1" title="picture of autumn leaves in front of Maluti mountains"></div>
          <p>Clarens, a gorgeous town found at the foothills of the Maluti mountains gets to sub zero temperatures at night. Yet somehow the day has beautiful sunshine, which is icing on the cake for a good hike.</p>

            <h4>Hiking along the coast of Coffee Bay in South Africa</h4>
            <p>27 June 2018 by Michelle Wong</p>
            <div class="backimg2"></div>
            <p>Tucked away in the Eastern Cape of South Africa is a gem of a town called 'Coffee Bay'. Apparently the name comes from the coffee beans from a cargo ship that washed up on its shore in the late 1800s.</p>

            <h4>Hiking in Cathkin Park, South Africa</h4>
            <p>20 June 2018 by Michelle Wong</p>
            <div class="backimg3" title="photo of Drakensberg mountains"></div>
            <p>I don't think I'll ever get sick of those verdant green hills of the Drakensberg. After spending two nights, three days hiking, I decided to visit Cahtkin Park, another part of the Drakensberg region. I stayed in possibly one of the best hostels ever called 'Inkosana Lodge'.</p>

            <h4>Care for a hike in 40 degrees? Tennant Creek - Northern Territory, Australia</h4>
            <p>13 April 2018 by Michelle Wong</p>
            <div class="backimg4" title="photo of red soil Tennant Creek"></div>
            <p>Hiking in the NT during the summer can be pretty arduous. Not only is the sun blazing down on you in all its glory, but there is pretty much no shade. Only the super committed (or crazy as some might say) would choose to embark on a hike at this time.</p>
