## Description of my portfolio website
### Purpose 
The purpose of this website is to convey my skills as a developer and my skills as a hardworking individual to prospective employers. This online portfolio showcases my strengths, interests, professional knowledge and some projects I have bene working on. 

I wanted to create a simple, minimalist and elegant design for my website. I used Dribble (see below for more specific examples) to help in this process and coolors. In terms of colours, I wanted something that was mostly neutral and pastel that wouldnâ€™t take away from the content or background images. I found the navy/dark blue, white and tan colours worked really well.

### Functionality / Features
My portfolio has five main pages and each page contains a nav bar and footer. The nav bar has links to the other pages in the porfolio (see below for detail on the pages) and the footer contains links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

#### Home page
This is the landing page. It has a hero text box with buttons linking to the about me page and contact me page. It was made using flex.

Home page Dribble inspiration

I loved how the North Face and REI had a beautiful landscape image and a hero text box. It was a minimalistic and simple but elegant design. I wanted to recreate something similar, as this really resonated with my love for the outdoors, hiking and a sense of adventure.

### Screenshots to show changes made to portfolio page
Originally the buttons were inside the card like this.

However, after I added the animation element to the cards, I thought it looked better to keep them out (see the screenshot above).

### Target audience
The target audience for this website are prospective employers looking to hire a developer or IT professional. The employer is expected to have an understanding of information technology, software development, programming languages and programming stacks. The future employer is also expected to be looking for employees with a good work ethic, the ability to work in teams, a real desire for learning (especially as programming languages are constantly evolving) and professionalism.

### Tech stack
The tech stack used to develop this website was HTML and CSS. 

The source files were pushed to GitHub. 

Netlify was used as the deployment platform to publish my website.
