## Description of my portfolio website
### Purpose 
The purpose of this website is to convey my skills as a developer and my skills as a hardworking individual to prospective employers. This online portfolio showcases my strengths, interests, professional knowledge and some projects I have bene working on. 

### Functionality / Features
My portfolio has five main pages and each page contains a nav bar and footer. The nav bar has links to the other pages in the porfolio (see below for detail on the pages) and the footer contains links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

#### Home page
This is the landing page. It has a hero text box with buttons linking to the about me page and contact me page. It was made using flex.

This page was made using grid. It has one section with text, background colour and a photo. There is also a button with a link to my CV.

However, after I added the animation element to the cards, I thought it looked better to keep them out (see the screenshot above).

### Target audience
The target audience for this website are prospective employers looking to hire a developer or IT professional. The employer is expected to have an understanding of information technology, software development, programming languages and programming stacks. The future employer is also expected to be looking for employees with a good work ethic, the ability to work in teams, a real desire for learning (especially as programming languages are constantly evolving) and professionalism.

### Tech stack
The tech stack used to develop this website was HTML and CSS. 

The source files were pushed to GitHub. 

Netlify was used as the deployment platform to publish my website.
